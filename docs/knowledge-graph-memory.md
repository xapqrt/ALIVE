# Knowledge Graph Memory MCP Server

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph Memory MCP server by Anthropic acts as "The Context Keeper" - it enables persistent memory for Claude and other AI assistants through a knowledge graph structure.

## What is Knowledge Graph Memory?

This MCP server provides:

- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers information across conversations
- **Knowledge Graph Structure**: Organizes information as interconnected nodes and relationships
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains context between different sessions
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Finds relevant information based on current context

## Features

### Memory Management
- Store and retrieve factual information
- Remember user preferences and context
- Maintain conversation history
- Track project-specific knowledge

### Knowledge Graph
- Create nodes for entities (people, projects, concepts)
- Define relationships between entities
- Query the graph for relevant context
- Visualize knowledge connections

### Integration Benefits
- Enhanced AI responses with remembered context
- Consistent behavior across sessions
- Personalized assistance based on stored preferences
- Project-aware suggestions and recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Information Storage**: As you interact with AI assistants, important information is automatically stored in the knowledge graph
2. **Relationship Mapping**: The server identifies and maps relationships between different pieces of information
3. **Context Retrieval**: When you ask questions or request assistance, relevant stored context is retrieved
4. **Memory Updates**: New information continuously updates and refines the knowledge graph

## Use Cases

- **Project Memory**: Remember project goals, decisions, and progress
- **Personal Preferences**: Store coding styles, tool preferences, and workflows
- **Team Knowledge**: Share and access team-specific information and conventions
- **Learning Progress**: Track what you've learned and areas for improvement

## Configuration

The Memory MCP server is configured to run locally and doesn't require external credentials. It stores data locally on your machine, ensuring privacy and fast access.

## Commands Available

Once installed, the Memory server provides tools for:
- Creating and updating memory entries
- Querying stored information
